# CS3310-PA4
In this program I use the Visitor Pattern to implement the following feature for a GSN model: Print all GSN elements in a top-down strategy (Starting with a root Goal and ending with all solution nodes) based on the GSN metamodel.
The input file is an XMI file of a GSN model. So, I used an XML DOM parser to read the XMI file. 
The program works great. Hope it helps you!
